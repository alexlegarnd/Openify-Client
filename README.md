# Openify Client
This software allows you to access your music from any computer (Mac or Windows with precompiled binaries).

# Server
The connection is made via HTTP(S), the server can be behind a proxy like NGinx
The server source and binaries can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/alexlegarnd/Openify-Server) (Openify Server)

# Known Issues
File format is OS dependant.
For Windows, I recommend to install DirectShow Filters (like K-Lite Mega).
